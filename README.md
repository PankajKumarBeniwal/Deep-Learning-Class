## In this particular repo, the Softmax based Logistic Regression techniques are being implemented on the widely used MNIST dataset, which contains a large data of images of numbers ranfing from 0-9. The MNIST dataset is splitted into train and test data and were later used in the training and testing of the model. 
At last the Training Accuracy achieved was 96.2034%
And, Testing Accuracy achieved was 96.3504% , which is very good considering the use of not a very high level model.
